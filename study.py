# what is tuple and list the syntax of them as well as the difference between them
# - A tuple is a data type in python used to store collections of data. Syntax: mytuple = ("item1", "item2", "item3")
# - A list is a data type in python used to store collections of data. Syntax: mylist = ["item1", "item2", "item3"]
# - A list is mutable, meaning the data inside can be changed, while a tuple is immutable
# - They are also both ordered

# what is the difference between function and method
# - A method is like a function, except it is attached to an object.
# - A method may alter an objectâ€™s state, but a function usually only operates on it, and then prints something
# - or returns a value.

# built in methods - dict = [4,5,6,7,8] - add a 5 at the end of this list - indexing
ldict = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
ldict.append(5)
print(ldict)

# declare 4 methods that take 4 arguments - no class is needed - specific functionality - method to return % of the 2
# values give

    return (e * 100) / f

def third(i, j, k, l):
    pass

def fourth(m, n, o, p):
    pass

print(first(45, 13, 3, 3))
